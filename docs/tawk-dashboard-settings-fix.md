# Tawk.to Dashboard Settings Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The Tawk.to widget was automatically popping up/maximizing on first visit, **ignoring the "Welcome message" disabled setting** in the Tawk.to dashboard.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was in the `TawkToChat.tsx` component where the code was **explicitly forcing the widget to show and maximize**, overriding the dashboard configuration:

### Problematic Code (Fixed):

```javascript
// ❌ This was forcing the widget to show
if (typeof window.Tawk_API.showWidget === 'function') {
	window.Tawk_API.showWidget()
}

// ❌ This was forcing the widget to maximize
if (typeof window.Tawk_API.maximize === 'function') {
	window.Tawk_API.maximize()
}
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed Forced Visibility**

- Eliminated all `showWidget()` and `maximize()` calls
- Removed explicit widget initialization that overrode dashboard settings
- Let Tawk.to respect its native dashboard configuration

### 2. **Added Respect Dashboard Settings Option**

- Added new prop: `respectDashboardSettings?: boolean` (defaults to `true`)
- When `true`: Widget follows dashboard visibility settings
- When `false`: Can still force visibility if needed for specific use cases

### 3. **Cleaned Up Interference**

- Reduced excessive console logging that might interfere with widget behavior
- Removed debug monitoring script that could affect widget initialization
- Simplified the initialization process

### 4. **Preserved Essential Functions**

- ✅ Color scheme application still works
- ✅ Mobile visibility control still works
- ✅ Custom attributes still get set
- ✅ Error handling remains robust

## 🎯 Key Changes Made

### In `TawkToChat.tsx`:

```diff
- // Force widget to show after a delay
- window.Tawk_API.showWidget();
- window.Tawk_API.maximize();

+ // Respect dashboard settings - do not force widget visibility
+ // Only set user attributes, do not force visibility
```

### In `ClientTawkToChat.tsx`:

```diff
+ respectDashboardSettings = true  // New prop with safe default
```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Disable "Welcome message" in Tawk.to dashboard**
2. **Clear browser cache** (important!)
3. **Visit your website** - widget should NOT auto-pop up
4. **Click the widget bubble** - chat should open normally
5. **Verify colors** - CheapCC brand colors should still apply

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Default Behavior (Respects Dashboard):

```tsx
<ClientTawkToChat /> // respectDashboardSettings defaults to true
```

### Force Widget to Show (Override Dashboard):

```tsx
<ClientTawkToChat respectDashboardSettings={false} />
```

## 📝 What This Means

- ✅ **Welcome message disabled** = Widget stays minimized until user clicks
- ✅ **Welcome message enabled** = Widget follows dashboard trigger settings
- ✅ **Colors and branding** = Still applied automatically
- ✅ **Mobile behavior** = Still controllable via `showOnMobile` prop
- ✅ **Error handling** = Still robust and graceful

## 🚀 Result

Your Tawk.to widget now **properly respects the dashboard settings**. When you disable the "Welcome message" in the Tawk.to admin panel, the widget will stay minimized until users actively click on it, providing a less intrusive user experience while maintaining full functionality.

_The fix maintains all existing functionality while ensuring the widget behavior matches your dashboard configuration preferences._
