  summary: 'Figma has become the dominant force in UI/UX design with superior collaboration and prototyping features, while Adobe Creative Cloud offers broader creative capabilities beyond UI design. With CheapCC\'s pricing, Adobe CC provides excellent value for teams needing both UI design and comprehensive creative tools.',
  introduction: `
    <p>The landscape of UI/UX design tools has shifted dramatically in recent years, with Figma emerging as the preferred choice for many design teams, challenging Adobe's long-standing dominance in the creative space.</p>
    
    <p>While Adobe XD was positioned as Adobe's answer to modern UI/UX design needs, Figma's collaborative approach and cloud-native architecture have resonated strongly with design teams working on digital products. However, Adobe Creative Cloud's comprehensive suite offers capabilities that extend far beyond UI design.</p>
    
    <p>This comparison examines both platforms from the perspective of UI/UX design workflows, team collaboration, prototyping capabilities, and integration with broader creative processes. We'll also consider how CheapCC's pricing affects the value equation for creative teams.</p>

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Has Figma completely replaced Adobe XD?",
      answer: "In many design teams, yes. Figma's collaborative features and superior prototyping capabilities have made it the preferred choice for UI/UX design. Adobe XD usage has declined significantly in favor of Figma."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do everything in Figma that I can in Adobe Creative Cloud?",
      answer: "No. While Figma excels at UI/UX design, it lacks the advanced photo editing (Photoshop), vector illustration (Illustrator), and motion graphics (After Effects) capabilities of Adobe Creative Cloud."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it worth learning Adobe XD if everyone uses Figma?",
      answer: "Focus on Figma for UI/UX design skills. However, learning the broader Adobe Creative Cloud suite can be valuable for comprehensive design roles that extend beyond UI design."
    },
    {
      question: "Which tool is better for design system management?",
      answer: "Figma is superior for design system management with its component system, design tokens, and collaborative features that make maintaining consistency across large teams much easier."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I collaborate as effectively in Adobe XD as in Figma?",
      answer: "No. Figma's real-time collaboration features are significantly more advanced than Adobe XD's collaboration capabilities. This is one of Figma's key competitive advantages."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get both Adobe Creative Cloud and Figma?",
      answer: "If your work extends beyond UI design to include brand design, marketing materials, photo editing, or video content, having both tools provides maximum flexibility. CheapCC's pricing makes Adobe CC more affordable alongside a Figma subscription."
