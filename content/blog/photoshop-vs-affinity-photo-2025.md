## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can Affinity Photo completely replace Photoshop?

For many users, yes. Affinity Photo handles about 90% of what most photographers and digital artists need. However, it lacks Photoshop's cutting-edge AI features, some specialized professional tools, and the extensive plugin ecosystem. If your workflow depends on these specific Photoshop capabilities or deep integration with other Adobe products, you may find Affinity Photo limiting.

### Will clients accept files from Affinity Photo?

Affinity Photo can open and save in PSD format, which helps with client compatibility. However, complex Photoshop files with smart objects, specific layer effects, or advanced features may not translate perfectly. For client work requiring exact Photoshop compatibility, it's safer to use Photoshop. Many professionals use Affinity for personal work and maintain Photoshop (often via discounted options like CheapCC) for client projects.

### Is Affinity Photo easier to learn than Photoshop?

Most new users find Affinity Photo's interface more intuitive and easier to navigate. Its "Persona" system organizes tools by workflow context, which can be more logical than Photoshop's panel-based approach. However, if you're already familiar with Photoshop, there will be an adjustment period when switching to Affinity Photo's different conventions and terminology.

### Which is better for photo retouching?

Both applications excel at photo retouching, but they shine in different areas:

- Photoshop offers more sophisticated AI-powered retouching tools like Neural Filters and Content-Aware Fill
- Affinity Photo has excellent traditional retouching tools and some unique features like the Inpainting Brush Tool

Professional retouchers generally prefer Photoshop for its more nuanced control and advanced capabilities, but Affinity Photo is more than capable for most retouching needs.

### How does CheapCC's Photoshop offering compare to Adobe's direct subscription?

CheapCC provides genuine Adobe Photoshop access at a significantly reduced price. The application itself is identical to what you'd get directly from Adobe—same features, same updates, same cloud services. The difference is purely in the pricing structure, making professional-grade tools more accessible to budget-conscious creatives.

## The Bottom Line: Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Adobe Photoshop (full price) if:

- You're in an enterprise environment with strict software procurement policies
- You need the absolute latest AI features immediately upon release
- Budget is not a significant concern

### Choose Adobe Photoshop via CheapCC if:

- You need industry-standard compatibility
- You work with clients expecting PSD files
- You want access to cutting-edge AI features
- You're looking to optimize costs without compromising capabilities

### Choose Affinity Photo if:

- You strongly prefer one-time purchase over subscription
- You're on a limited budget
- You primarily need core photo editing capabilities
- You don't require extensive third-party plugin support
- You rarely need to collaborate with Adobe users

For most photographers and digital artists looking for professional-grade tools without breaking the bank, Adobe Photoshop through CheapCC offers the best combination of industry-standard capabilities and cost efficiency.
