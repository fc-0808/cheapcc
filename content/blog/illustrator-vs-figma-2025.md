## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can Figma replace Illustrator completely?

For UI/UX designers focused primarily on screen-based designs, Figma can replace most Illustrator functionality. However, designers working on print projects, complex illustrations, or requiring precise vector control will find Figma limiting. Figma lacks many advanced vector manipulation features, print preparation tools, and the precision required for complex illustration work.

### Is it worth maintaining both applications?

Many professional designers find value in using both tools for their respective strengths. Figma excels at UI design and collaboration, while Illustrator provides superior vector editing capabilities. For designers who work across both digital and print mediums, having access to both tools (with Illustrator available through CheapCC to minimize costs) provides the most versatile toolkit.

### Can I move files between Illustrator and Figma?

Yes, with some limitations. SVG is the most reliable interchange format between the two applications. Complex Illustrator effects, blends, and certain path operations may not translate perfectly to Figma. Many designers create base artwork in Illustrator, export as SVG, and then import into Figma for UI implementation and collaboration.

### Which is better for icon design?

Both tools are capable of creating excellent icons, but they excel in different aspects:

- Illustrator provides more precise vector control, better pathfinder operations, and advanced shape manipulation
- Figma offers better component management, instant collaboration, and direct implementation into design systems

For creating complex, highly detailed icons, Illustrator typically offers more control. For designing consistent icon systems that integrate with UI, Figma's component features provide advantages.

### How difficult is it to switch from Illustrator to Figma?

The learning curve when switching from Illustrator to Figma is relatively gentle for basic operations. Figma's interface is more simplified and intuitive in many respects. However, experienced Illustrator users may find themselves missing advanced vector manipulation features and may need to adjust their workflow. The most successful transitions typically involve learning Figma's component system, auto layout, and collaboration features while potentially maintaining Illustrator access for specialized vector work.

## The Bottom Line: Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Adobe Illustrator (standard price) if:

- You work primarily in print design or illustration
- You need maximum vector editing precision and control
- You're in an enterprise environment with established Adobe workflows
- Budget is not a primary concern

### Choose Adobe Illustrator via CheapCC if:

- You need professional-grade vector capabilities
- You work in both print and digital design
- You want to complement Figma with specialized vector tools
- You're looking to optimize costs while maintaining professional capabilities

### Choose Figma if:

- Your work focuses primarily on UI/UX design
- Real-time collaboration is essential to your workflow
- You need strong component and design system features
- You want the best prototyping and developer handoff capabilities

### Choose Both (Figma + Illustrator via CheapCC) if:

- You work across multiple design disciplines
- You create complex vector artwork that feeds into UI designs
- You need both collaboration features and advanced vector capabilities
- You want a cost-effective solution that doesn't compromise capabilities

For many designers in 2025, maintaining access to both platforms provides the most versatile toolkit, with CheapCC making the combined approach financially viable by providing Adobe Illustrator access at a fraction of the standard subscription cost.
