# CheapCC vs. Adobe Direct: A 2025 Price Comparison

When it comes to getting access to Adobe Creative Cloud, you have two primary options: subscribing directly from Adobe or using a service like CheapCC to get a genuine subscription at a significant discount. But what's the difference, and how much can you actually save?

This article breaks down the costs, features, and the legitimacy of both options so you can make an informed decision.

## What Do You Get With Each Subscription?

This is the most important question, and the answer is simple: **the product is exactly the same.**

Whether you buy from Adobe directly or through CheapCC, you receive:

- **Full Access to All Apps:** Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and more.
- **100GB of Cloud Storage:** The standard amount for the All Apps plan.
- **Adobe Firefly & AI Features:** Full access to Adobe's generative AI tools.
- **Regular Updates:** Your apps will receive all the latest updates directly through the Creative Cloud desktop app.
- **Official Adobe Account:** You get your own credentials to log in at adobe.com.

The only difference is the price you pay.

## The Price Difference: A Head-to-Head Comparison

Here's where the value of CheapCC becomes clear. We've taken the official prices listed on Adobe's site and compared them to our pricing.

| Plan Duration | Adobe Official Price | CheapCC Price | **Your Savings**    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 Month       | $79.99               | $14.99        | **$65.00 (81%)**    |
| 3 Months      | $239.97              | $39.99        | **$199.98 (83%)**   |
| 6 Months      | $479.94              | $69.99        | **$409.95 (85%)**   |
| 12 Months     | $599.88              | $89.99        | **$509.89 (85%)**   |

_Note: Prices are based on standard monthly/annual rates at the time of writing and are subject to change._

As you can see, the savings are substantial. For a one-year subscription, you save over $500. This isn't a trial or a limited version; it's the full experience for a fraction of the cost.

## How Is This Possible and Is It Legit?

This is the most common question we get. We are able to offer these prices by leveraging educational and enterprise volume licensing agreements. We purchase a large number of subscriptions at a discounted rate and pass those savings directly on to you.
